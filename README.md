# Simple Neural Network for Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a basic feed-forward neural network built in PyTorch for classifying the Iris dataset. The repository includes code for model creation, dataset handling, training, and evaluation, with a Jupyter Notebook to showcase usage.



## Project Structure

- **`model.py`**: Defines the `NeuralNetwork` model class, with functions for training and evaluating the model.
- **`data_utils.py`**: Contains `BuildDataset`, which loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset and returns DataLoader objects for training and testing.
- **`run.py`**: Demonstrates how to use the model and dataset functions to train and evaluate the neural network.



## Dataset

This project uses the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), which contains:
- **150 samples** of iris flowers, each with **4 features**:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- **3 classes** for classification: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.



##  Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries**:
  - PyTorch
  - scikit-learn
  
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install torch scikit-learn

````

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuralnetwork-model.git
cd neuralnetwork-model

2. Run the run.py code
The easiest way to use this project is by opening and running the code in run.py. This provides a step-by-step guide to:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Initialize and train the model

Evaluate the model on test data

## Usage Guide
Alternatively, you can use the code files directly. Hereâ€™s how to set up and train the model in a Python script.

Import the Necessary Modules

from model import NeuralNetwork, train, evaluate

from data_utils import BuildDataset

import torch

import torch.nn as nn

import torch.optim as optim


Initialize Dataset Loaders

train_loader, test_loader = BuildDataset(batch_size=16)


Configure and Initialize the Model

input_size = 4       # Number of input features

hidden_size = 10     # Size of the hidden layer

output_size = 3      # Number of output classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

model = NeuralNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


Train the Model

train(model, criterion, optimizer, train_loader, epochs=10)

Evaluate the Model

evaluate(model, test_loader)
